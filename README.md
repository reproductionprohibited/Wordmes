# Wordmes
This is a desktop app, currently waiting for its Windows distributable non-stable release ( macOS and Linux to be added soon )

This app consists of mini-word-games that you can play from any point on the globe, with just having access to the Internet ( there's only 1 game that can be played without internet )
The list of games is:
  * ***Wordle***
  * ***Sharkman***
  * ***Words from a word***
  * ***Bulls & Cows***

## Wordle
This is a game, where you have to guess a word in 6 tries. After each step you receive additional information that can help you

## Sharkman
This is a well-known game called Hangman with 8 tries and other pictures, the game process remains untouched: you make guessed that are one letter, and if that letter is present in the guessed word, all repeats of this letter become revealed in the word.

## Words from a word
In this mini-game, you can choose 1 of 100 words and start assembling new words with the letters present in the starting word. There're 3 milestones:
  * ***5 words - you receive 1st star***
  * ***12 words - you receive 2nd star***
  * ***25 words - you receive 3rd star***
*P.S. You can continue assembling new words, 25 isn't the limit*

## Bulls & Cows
The only game that doesn't require internet connection. You pick one of 2 difficulty modes: Normal ( 4-digit number ) and Hard ( 6-digit number )
The goal is to guess the number. After each step, you get new information: Bulls are digits that are in their positions, and cows are digits that are present in the guessed number, but they're not in their positions.

*P.S. The game is in its development stage, so stay tuned for new features & games.*
