# Wordmes
This is my IT semester project. To be precise, a set of mini-games, requiring Internet connection, that you can play ( obviously ).
And if you don't know rules to any of the games, just chill. I got your back with a detailed description of gameplay process INSIDE the app
## First Game - Wordle
Yes, this is not an original idea, but i decided to extend it a little - I added different modes - 5 / 6 / 7 letter-words that you have to guess
## Second Game - Sharkman
This game is a modification of a famous game 'Hangman' where you have to name words and if the letters of the word you're saying appear in the word the master player has guessed, then all the appearances of this letter uncover in the guessed word.
But in this mod, you have to type in letters. That's not as easy as it looks like, even though you've got 8 attempts to leave the shark hungry and fierced
## Third Game - Words from Word
A classical game. You just have to assemble words from the letters of the big word. But in this mod, there're 3 difficulty levels:
#### 1. Easy
Here you have to assemble 5 words and there's no punishment for entering a non-fitting word
#### 2. Normal
Here you have to assemble 7 words and punishment: -1 pts
#### 3. Hard
10 words to assemble and -2 for each non-fitting word
However, there's no punishment for words that include letters, that don't appear in the main word, only the combinations of letters that don't make a word

***Have fun playing!***
